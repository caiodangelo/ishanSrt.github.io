Unfortunately this post is also going to be super short. Just couldn't
keep my thoughts together and get up and write some cock sucking, bad-ass blogs
as I have been doing in the beginning.

## Here's a list of accomplishments:

### Got the [**cEP**](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0022.md) [<sup>**[*]**</sup>](#help) merged.
But it feels like a pity merge since I
wasn't moving forward with anything. (Now that's an accomplishment
to brag about ðŸ˜—).
Still I am glad its over. I was done with just sitting and
thinking and it was nice taking a break and doing some actual
stuff. Gonna improve upon it / add implementation details later
on probably in the starting of the third coding phase.

### Got a [**Pull Request**](https://github.com/coala/coala-quickstart/pull/250) merged
(approx 600 lines).
Turns out Satwik ([@satwikkansal](https://github.com/satwikkansal)) was right
about the
speedy coding process after the idea is finalised. It took hardly
any time but the review process was tedious. I wish we could set
up some in between sort of **"coding meet ups"**. (I meet up with him
every sunday
at 7 p.m. on [gitter](https://gitter.im)
**a.k.a. regular meet-ups** and he also replies as soon as
he sees the notification
whenever I ping him in the middle of the week, but its still tedious). He gives
some reviews to me and I fix them almost
immediately (yeah right, I don't seem to be having a life like these other
people and I stay online all the time on gitter, replying immediately)
but then its not until the next day or 4-6 hours after, 
that, that I get a new
set of reviews which took it almost a week to get the Pull Request finalised.

The Pull Request is about seperating the arguments to the `run`/`create_arguments`
methods of [bears](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears) <sup>
[Reference 1](http://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Native_Bears.html#communicating-with-the-user),
[Reference 2](http://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Linter_Bears.html#writing-the-bear)
</sup> which accept boolean values from the ones which
accept any other kinds
of values. They have also been categorised into optional arguments
and non-optional arguments. The data is stored in a class whose object
is returned to the main method for
[coala-quickstart](https://github.com/coala/coala-quickstart/blob/bed7e51280f8aad3763efc4323a17967d7ae6019/coala_quickstart/coala_quickstart.py#L68).
There was a
slight complication in the middle where some arguments had type annotaions
like
```python
def run(my_awesome_setting: bool = None):
```
due to which I had to refactor everything. As earlier I was sorting everything
based on the default value but now I had to consider the possibilities that:
* a bear setting<sup> (arguments to the `run` or `create_arguments` methods)
  </sup> can have a default value but no type annotaion.
* can have a type annotaion and no default value.
* have both of them.
* have none.

So that took some time but the task is complete and everything's working fine.
Also parsed the
[bear dependency tree](https://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Native_Bears.html#bears-depending-on-other-bears)
to check recursively for non-optional
settings to the bears. Considered the possibility of using dynamic programming
algorithms but it felt as a kind of premature optimisation and the present
bear dependencies are hardly complex in coala.

## Here's a list of unsuccesful events:

### Wasted quite a few days last week
I did nothing, just literally nothing, gazing at the roof, the ceiling fan,
whirring about doing its business. (You've got no right to judge me, we all
are guilty of indulging in these kinds of day dreams)

### Had decided that I could seperate all the settings before today
But hit a
[bottle neck](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/issues/2532#issue-330945748)
over there with the
[contracts](https://andreacensi.github.io/contracts/)
package giving me a hard
time on adding type annotations and value checks to
[Type 3](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/blob/master/cEP-0022.md#type-3-or-type-discrete-settings)
settings.

That's it. Buzz off from here. I've been looking forward to posting my awesome
blogs instead of this non-interesting update stuff. A juicy blog is on its
way this week.
