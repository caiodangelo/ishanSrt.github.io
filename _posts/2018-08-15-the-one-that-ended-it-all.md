So Since the last few days this had been my daily schedule:

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<img src="../assets/blurry_files/morning.placeholder.jpg" alt="" data-echo="../assets/images/morning.gif">{: class="center-image"}

<div>&nbsp;</div>

The good news is we all passed (atleast my group of friends). We have formed this special bond over this short
period of time. We have almost equal level of knowledge but about different things (for eg. Virresh([@virresh](https://github.com/virresh))
is our dependency, CI and moban genius while Vaibhav([@RaiVaibhav](https://github.com/RaiVaibhav)) can tell you about any module you
need to use from the coala core) but the most fun part is that most of our
discusssions include decoding John's cryptographic reviews and comments on each other's PRs or messages. We hate the same people
and we adore the same people. We help each with the knowledge
we have and I really think that I would have remained dumb struck or wasted so many hours figuring different
things that pop up every now and then if it weren't for their help.
