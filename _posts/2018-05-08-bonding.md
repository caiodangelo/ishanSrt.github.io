Yeah so after spending the previous month writing, understanding and delving
deeper and deeper into the
[pdb](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html) and
[bdb](https://docs.python.org/2/library/bdb.html) modules and the three months
before that getting familiar with coala, I got selected into GSoC!!

Yay!!

But not for the project I prepared for
([Debug and Profile Bears](http://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=debug_and_profile_bears&lang=en)).
I got selected for my backup proposal
[Quickstart Green Mode](https://projects.coala.io/#/projects?project=quickstart_green_mode&lang=en).

## Uggh...

To be frank I felt pissed off at first taking into account how many mock ups
I had build, went as far as building the mock-up version of the profiler on
my own fork, which is [here](https://github.com/ishanSrt/coala/pull/1), and
was
constantly in touch with [@Makman2](https://github.com/Makman2),

*sigh...*

I have grown enough in my life to
form the mindset to accept life as it is and to make the most out of it.
Don't know what's wrong with me? I got selected into GSoC and my first
emotions were cribbing.

Well now that I look back, adversities in life (not that it was any adversity)
are a blessing in disguise. I already knew how the Debugger and the Profiler
were gonna be implemented (at least the general idea of it) and now I
get to build something back from scratch and learn something new each day!
(no sarcasm intended over here)

A great thanks to John again for making up my mind to write the backup
proposal in the last 2 hours of the submission deadline. The first thought
that came in my mind when he mentioned backup was, what kind of bullshit
is he talking about? But yeah then he started mentioning examples of
people like Ce Gao ([@gaoegege](https://github.com/gaocegege)) who were
saved by backup proposal in some other org in the earlier years and now
he was back as a mentor! That motivated me to write my backup proposal.

Would really like to thank Mischa, Ce Gao, John and Satwik for reviewing both
my proposals and helping me improving upon my work!
 
Well I had been talking to John ([@jayvdb](https://github.com/jayvdb)) and
Satwik ([@satwikkansal](https://github.com/satwikkansal)) about this project
at the
time of writing the proposal and I had the general idea of what was meant to
be done, so for the newbies to this blog,

## So what the heck is this *'green'* mode?

So for a layman, [coala](https://coala.io) is a tool with which you detect
inconsistencies in code, means how it is written, proper indentation, proper
codestyles etcetera etcetra. You may need a config file for large projects
to configure coala and pass settings to it.
For eg.. whether you want to use
single quotes `'` throughout your project or some files or whether you want to
use double quotes `"`. Whether you wanted to use spaces or tabs as an
indentation (it matters a lot in python). These different kinds of perks are
controlled by
[coala-bears](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears).
There are a wide range of bears already available
([check here](https://coala.io/#/languages)) and you can even form
your own for your own personal use
([check here](https://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Native_Bears.html)),
or put up a Pull Request if you think it will
be helpful for others too!. coala can fix most of these perks for you
and I seriously didn't knew that all the orgs already used some kind of a
*"linting"* (You may need to Google the word *linter*) tool
like this to maintain consistency along their codebases and this was a shocking
fact for me when I joined this org. coala unifies the functionality of all
these existing tools and adds its own treats for you.
So anyways
[coala-quickstart](https://github.com/coala/coala-quickstart) is a tool which
analyses some of the aspects of the project and cooks you a config file for the
project in the beginning itself! What a great tool! Yeah but it has some short
comings and I need to improve upon it.

So what the current situation is that quickstart generates files on certain
assumptions and by collecting some metadata for eg.. from the `.editorconfig`
files but its not *that* accurate and points out too may errors or
inconsistencies in the code base. Many organisations don't follow standard
coding styles, they instead follow their own custom configurations which
means the project administrators need to take out time to learn about the
bears and their capabilities and then manually make the configuration files.
This is undesirable and hinders the adoption of coala across communities.
The project demands me to make coala-quickstart capable of **generating
project compatible
config files** which assume that the code base is correct as of now,
generate no errors and only detects errors in future commits.

## So how am I gonna do it?

The fact is that I don't know, I am forming my
[cEP](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/pull/139) which are
[PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) equivalents
for coala and the implementation is still in the making. I have already revamped
my cEP completely once, currently awaiting more reviews.

So the basic idea what I am gonna do is use a brute force to search through the
code base collecting metadata on my way and then guess or drop the settings of
the bears. If the required settings (without which the bears can't work) cannot
be guessed then I will drop the entire bear or if its just an optional setting,
I will just drop that setting.

The next stage of my project will involve improving upon the brute force to
reduce the time taken by brute force, make the config files more specific to the
project so that no setting that can be guessed is left out and coala doesn't
fail to point out inconsistencies in future commits.

And for the final part, it will involve training an evil army of newcomers
to land PRs (Pull Requests) in other orgs for the generated `.coafile` or config
file so that they may be tempted to use coala for their CI or whatever their
needs are. (**Bwahaha!** sounds like a plan!)

## So how has it been going?

I would say **[esketit!!!](https://youtu.be/J1zlCmSzlG8?t=10)** (sure
whatever the hell that means). Been talking extensively with Satwik who is my
primary mentor and also with Adhityaa ([@adtac](https://github.com/adtac)) who is
my
secondary mentor and quite enjoying my work. I laugh at myself asking Satwik at
the time of writing proposals that this shit seems so simple, why make a project
out of it? Ah! sweet ignorance. Ignorance **is** bliss. Now I am doing it, I get
to know the intrecacies involved and the same reply I got from Satwik when I
asked
this question. Anyways walking into the wild and paving your own path has a fun
of its own.
In the meantime getting familiar with the quickstart repo and solving some bugs.

There are so many questions that are asked to me about this project by others
and the answer is "I still don't know". Can't wait to start coding as many
of the troubles and subtlities will unfold on their own, plus I get to sit
behind my computer all day! What can be more fun that this!
