This would be just a short update primarily because I don't feel
like writing a blog (well who does? It's not like anybody reads
the crap I write, but the thing is once you get your ass on the chair,
determined to write all the blogs for the entire month in one go, you
actually start enjoying the stuff. You want to be better at it and want
to be the next [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/), due to which you
end up completing only 25% of your work which leaves you again with
a todo list and burden at the back of your mind that you've got to still
complete your blog work. Sigh!! *The sweet irony of enjoying and hating
the same stuff at
the same moment*) and also because things uptil now were mostly uneventful.

Gonna start of by telling about my
[cEP](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/pull/139) [<sup>[*]</sup>](#help)
which is still in the
making. Did I mention that I have sat for hours thinking about
what can and cannot go wrong and what border cases am I leaving
yet something or the other keeps popping up that crumbles all my hopes
of ever getting the `cEP` merged?

Apart from that I hardly know any of my fella GSoC mates who has
successfully merged the `cEP`. (I am too lazy to find out whether
Boxuan Li ([@li-boxuan](https://github.com/li-boxuan)) has merged
the `cEP` before this date by which I mean off the record I completely
fake the dates. I never deliver my blogs on time üòè and if you are an
on the record type of person, you can take it as a prophecy that he will
be the
first one to get his `cEP` merged.

Getting a great amount of help from
Satwik ([@satwikkansal](https://github.com/satwikkansal)),
my primary mentor. He keeps emphasizing upon the fact that the coding would
be a fast process but whats important is to create a well defined,
non-ambiguous idea first and he may be right in many ways. I often
find myself wasting hours figuring out that the code i just wrote
won't work for a border case and I've got to change it now but the fact
that most border cases don't turn up just by thinking and not doing
anything is a matter of concern too. What we need to do is find is a middle
ground somewhere over here and I am writing all this crap just to covey
that I am turning head over heels nuts and sick as parrot
over writing and editing
the `cEP`.

The [gitmate](https://gitmate.io/)-bot puking over my `cEP` every now and
then with 10s of comments, me
not being able to get the dependencies for
[MarkDownBear](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/blob/master/bears/markdown/MarkdownBear.py)
installed correctly
and actually outsourcing that stuff from 
Nitanshu ([@nvzard](https://github.com/nvzard)). He has literally been running
`MarkDownBear` over my PR and giving me with gists with the fixed code which I
copy with no shame. Thank you Nitanshu, you are an awesome guy and may the
guys from [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)
rott in hell as I tried every other thing to get the
dependencies right. With my second Pull Request for the `cEP` also about to go
unicorns,

and no ray of hope of it getting merged anytime soon, I am starting to
think I should start with some coding on the side too, should probably talk to
Satwik about it. I can see the org's
guidelines *"of your `cEP` getting merged before the coding phase"* go down the
drain
pretty smoothely.

Till that time got a hold of what is happening with the
[mobans](https://gitlab.com/coala/mobans) repo and how most
of the dependency related stuff is being generated with the help of that.
Solved a
few issues too here and there. But mostly understood a tonne of dependency
related
stuff from Virresh ([@Virresh](https://github.com/virresh)). Its actually a very
clever way to generate files like `setup.py`, `requirements.txt` and CI
configuration using [moban](http://moban.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
which is just a command line [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) parser.

All in all I am happy with whatever I am doing, happy to be around such awesome
people doing amazing stuff and am just glad to be able to work my way through
it, tackling one problem after the other.
