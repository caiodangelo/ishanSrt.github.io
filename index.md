All our lives we are made to believe that life is just the way it is and our job is to fit in. We need to play it safe, we need to obey the rules, we need to learn to compromise, we can't chase after our dreams because we are not smart enough, rich enough, talented enough or worthy enough.
### This is terrible advice!


Because when we do chase after our dreams, when we do feel discomfort and still decide to do it, that is when we experience life at its fullest. It is the things in life that are undetermined that make life interesting and worth living, your life moving so fast, so full, you won't even have time to process it.

So keep working hard, do what you love and keep on doing things that are out of your comfort zone.

Let this blog be an inspiration for you and for me whenever I read this.
